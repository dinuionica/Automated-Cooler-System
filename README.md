# Automated-Cooler-System

This project is an automated cooler system, a system based on an Arduino board, which controls two cooling motors based on temperature values taken from sensors. Each motor is surrounded by an rgb led strip. The circuit also contains three light bulbs that light up depending on the temperature value. The project was made using the online platform tinkercad.
